# Bootstrap-HW
For this project I was tasked with making a responsive portfolio design. I was also supposed to utilize bootstrap components like then navbar and contact page. I created 3 html pages in total all linked to one css style page. For my index.html I have my Home/about me information along with a navbar from boostrap. For my second html page titled 'contact.html' I created the programming for my contact page. I used a bootstrap navbar to keep it consistent and also used the bootstrap property for the overall contact form. For my third page titled 'portfolio' I created the programming for my portfolio page. One this page I also included a bootstrap navbar as well as the bootstrap properties for responsive images. Throughout the html pages I made use of the Grid components system to be able to get my pieces where I needed them. For my css page titled style.css. I tried to keep the styling consistent throughout each page. I used the @media tag to make the pages responsive to shrinking of the window. 


## Installation

I am providing a link to the github reposistory that should link to the website. 


## Usage 

This page is going to be used as my personal portfolio page. I will upload pictures of my completed projects and other things i am working on. It will basically be a living breathing resume. 


## Credits

I would like to thank Bryan Swarthout and Wilson Lam for providing the basic idea for the webpage and the knowledge and supplemental code necessary to begin.
